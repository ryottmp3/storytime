Storytime is two games: a text-adventure game and a rogue-like RPG.

The plan is to write a story first (text adventure type thing)
then write the rogue-like graphics/etc part of the game.

The Text Adventure Portion will be written in Python 3.12,
as it will allow for quick and simple development in an 
appropriate scripting language.
Development environments will be achieved using pyenv and pipenv.

The Rogue-Like portion will be written in C++, as it is a compiled
language and can be packaged, not requiring an interpreter to run.
The hope is that this will allow the software to be more
cross-platform.
